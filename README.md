# vertex-ai-project-example
Welcome! This is an example project for demonstrating how to build an extensible, production-ready project on Vertex AI for image use cases.
It is built specifically for the [Mineral](https://x.company/projects/mineral/) team but has some ideas that might be useful to share.

## How to use
## Folder structure
- Data labelling
- Data processing
- Training
- Workspace

### Workspace
Here is where you create your datasets and training pipelines.

## Concepts
- Pipelines as extensible Python classes
- Automated training via Cloud Build

## Out-of-scope
MLOps, such as model monitoring, feature store, etc
